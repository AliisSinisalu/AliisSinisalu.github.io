 Raamatust "Vagabonding:An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long Term World Travel" by Rolf Potts, leidsin üsna palju (vähemalt minu jaoks) inspireerivaid mõtteid. Tahaksin neid ka teiega jagada. Praegu on küll mu elu läinud sedamoodi, et vaevalt ma kuhugi üksi hakkan seiklema minema - no seljakotiränduriks ma mõtlen (Pruutus ju seljakotti ei mahu), aga see on miski, mida oleksin tahtnud kogeda või never know... vb üke hetk ka kogen.

Mõned tsiteeringud siis:

"The more we associate experiences with cash value, the more we think that money is what we need to live. And the more we associate money with life, the more we convince ourselves that we're too poor to buy our freedom."

"Long-term travel isn't about being a college student; it's about being a student of a daily life. Long-term travel isn't an act of rebellion against society; it's an act of common sense within society. Long-term travel doesn't require a massive bundle of cash; it requires only that we walk through the world in a more deliberate way."

"And, as much as anything, vagabonding is about time - our only real commodity - and how we choose to use it."

"Settling into our lives, we get so obsessed with holding on to our domestic certainties that we forget why we desired them in the first place"

"Quitting - whether a job or a habit - means taking a turn so as to be sure you're still moving in the direction of your dreams."

"...there is still an overwhelming social compulsion - an insanity of consensus, if you will - to get rich from life rather than live richly, to do well in the world instead of living well"

"Thus, if some people consider your travels foolish, don't waste your time trying to convince them otherwise."

"Vagabonding is not just a process of discovering the world but a way of seeing - an attitude that prepares you to find the things you weren't looking for."

"You may be excited, bored, confused, desperate and amazed all in the same happy day."

"Vagabonding is like a pilgrimage without a specific destination or goal - not a quest for answers so much as a celebration of the questions, an embrace of the ambiguous, and an openness to anything that comes your way."

"We need sometimes to escape into open solitudes, into aimlessness, into the moral holiday of running some pure hazard, in order to sharpen the edge of life, to taste hardship, and to be compelled to work desperately for a moment no matter what."
George Santayana

"Having an adventure is sometimes just a matter of going out and allowing things to happen in a strange and amazing new environment - not so much a physical challenge as a psychic one."

"The secret of adnenture, then, is not to carefully seek it out but to travel in such a way that it finds you. To do this, you first need to overcome the protective habits of home and open yourself up to unpredictability. As you begin to practise this openness, you'll quickly discover adventure in the simple reality of a world that defies your expectations."

"Don't travel in order to get away from anyplace. Do it to be wherever you are that night when you go to sleep. And if you are not happy with the where you are or what you're doing, it is all right to move on, or just give up and go home."
Eamonn Gearon

"We go where we need to go, and then try to figure out what were doing there."

"People say that what we are all seeking is a meaning of life. I don't think this is what we're really seeking. I think what we're seeking is an experience of being alive."
Joseph Campbell

Vot siuksed lood siis. Tegelikult mul on endal veits häbi ka, kui palju mõtetut pahna on mul 6 aasta jooksul kogunenud. Hetkel tunnengi, elu kokku pakkides, et see on nagu puhastumine. Aga eks aja jooksul väärtused muutuvadki ja minulgi on veel pikk ma minna jõudmaks nende väärtusteni, mida olen hakanud hindama praegusel eluperioodil.
