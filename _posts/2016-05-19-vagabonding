 Raamatust "Vagabonding:An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long Term World Travel" by Rolf Potts, leidsin üsna palju (vähemalt minu jaoks) inspireerivaid mõtteid. Tahaksin neid ka teiega jagada. Praegu on küll mu elu läinud sedamoodi, et vaevalt ma kuhugi üksi hakkan seiklema minema - no seljakotiränduriks ma mõtlen (Pruutus ju seljakotti ei mahu), aga see on miski, mida oleksin tahtnud kogeda või never know... vb üke hetk ka kogen.

Mõned tsiteeringud siis:

"The more we associate experiences with cash value, the more we think that money is what we need to live. And the more we associate money with life, the more we convince ourselves that were too poor to buy our freedom."

"Long-term travel isnt about being a college student; it's about being a student of a daily life. Long-term travel isn't an act of rebellion against society; it's an act of common sense within society. Long-term travel doesn't require a massive bundle of cash; it requires only that we walk through the world in a more deliberate way."
